# VedioFunPC

## Requirement

The server-side of my video recording app.
- Synv and send back all the current video info.
- Connecting DB

## TODO

Ironically, the most obvious bug is the mis-spelling 'vedio'.

It exists in everywhere. And shame on me, I don't want to correct it at all

- Change code from java to python
- Switch SQLite DB to MongoDB Atlas DB (Free of charge, easy to connect globally)
